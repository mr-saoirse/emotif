Three former presidents - Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton - have said they are also prepared to be inoculated publicly./nMr Biden has also reiterated his call for Americans to wear a mask for 100 days - a measure that he said combined with vaccine distribution would see deaths \"drop off the edge\". /n\"My hope is they will then be inclined to say it\\'s worth the patriotic duty to go ahead and protect other people,\" Mr Biden said./nThe US fight to control the coronavirus pandemic is about to slam head-first into a national anti-vaccine movement that is stubbornly pervasive./nThat reality may be behind President-elect Biden\\'s statement that he would not support a government mandate that all Americans receive a Covid-19 vaccination. The attempt to implement one - even if supported by science and legal precedent dating back more than a century - could create a groundswell of opposition that would prove counterproductive to public health./nSuch was the case with mask-wearing - a less intrusive step to prevent the spread of the virus - which, over the past six months, has become infused with politics./nMr Biden, and state governors who would be on the front lines of any such mandate, might prefer to target only certain segments of the population more at risk of contracting or spreading Covid-19. For instance, employers could be encouraged to require healthcare and nursing home workers to be immunised, and most children already must have up-to-date shot records before attending public or private schools./nWhile the speedy development of multiple vaccines has offered reason for hope of more normal life after the coronavirus pandemic, a brewing vaccination fight is just one example of how managing this public-health crisis in the coming months will not be an easy task for the Biden administration./nThe health body said it was now recommending that people wear masks anywhere outside their own homes - including indoors./nIt said the country was in a phase of \"high-level transmission\" as colder weather was seeing more people spend more time indoors./nAbout half of new cases were the result of transmission from infected people who did not have any symptoms, the CDC said./nIt said mask wearing, physical distancing and avoiding non-essential indoor spaces and crowded outdoor spaces were part of a \"multi-pronged\" approach needed to \"provide a bridge\" to a future where vaccines were widely available and normal life could resume./nOn Thursday Mr Biden said he would make mask-wearing in federal buildings mandatory./nMeanwhile, California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom has issued a stay-at-home order for much of his state. On Wednesday, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti issued an order restricting all public travel on foot or vehicle, adding: \"It\\'s time to cancel everything.\"/nMr Biden described the latest jobs data as \"grim\". /nFigures from November, released earlier on Friday, showed that a lower-than-expected 245,000 new jobs were added as the rate of new daily infections almost doubled./n\"It shows an economy that\\'s stalling and remains in the midst of one of the worst economic and job crisis in modern history,\" Mr Biden said./nHe predicted \"the future will be very bleak\" if lawmakers fail to pass a coronavirus rescue aid package immediately./nUnless Congress enacts another relief bill, more than nine million jobless Americans will be cut off from unemployment benefits after Christmas./nLawmakers from both parties have been inching towards a $900bn (\\xc2\\xa3670bn) plan that would include expanded unemployment benefits./nJohnson and EU chief seek to break Brexit deadlock/nEU and UK negotiators call in leaders in last ditch effort to secure a trade deal./nWill a vaccine give us our old lives back?/nRussia begins Covid vaccinations in Moscow/nThe neo-Nazi who became an anti-Nazi/n\\'I had surgery to be three inches taller\\'/nIt\\'s rare to find art that blows you away.

But some of the pieces being calved are significant objects in their own right and will need tracking because of the additional hazard they will now pose to shipping./nThe A400m\\'s new imagery - stills and video - will be analysed to try to understand how the berg might behave in the coming weeks and months./nAlthough currently heading straight at South Georgia, A68a is being carried in fast-moving waters that should divert the bloc in a loop around the southern part of the island. /nThere is considerable interest in whether the berg might then ground on the territory\\'s continental shelf. /nShould that happen, it could cause considerable difficulties for the island\\'s seals and penguins as they try to get out to sea to forage for fish and krill./nWhen A68a broke away from an ice shelf in Antarctica in July 2017, it measured nearly 6,000 sq km - about a quarter of the size of Wales. At 4,200 sq km, it now has an area closer to that of an English county like Somerset. /nExperts are surprised the iceberg hasn\\'t lost more of its bulk.

Italy, supported by Germany, wanted a European agreement to close all ski resorts over the holiday, but in two countries - Switzerland and Austria - the ski lifts will be running. Some ski slopes in northern Spain also hope to open./nThe risk of catching coronavirus at ski resorts is already well known. In February and March, apr\\xc3\\xa8s-ski bars at resorts like Ischgl in Austria\\'s Tyrol helped spread the virus across Europe. /nAustria\\'s ski slopes are currently closed, but will be allowed to open on Christmas Eve. However, tight restrictions will make ski holidays all but impossible for anyone who isn\\'t local. /nBut ski slopes in Switzerland - outside the EU - are already open, much to the disapproval of its neighbours./nIt\\'s that time of year again. Snow, which the Swiss sometimes call weisses Gold (white gold), has been falling, and local hopes are heavily invested in thoughts of skiing. /nNot just because they love to ski themselves, but because the livelihoods of entire regions of the country depend on winter sports. In Grindelwald they are opening two brand new ski lifts that cost $500m (\\xc2\\xa3370m; \\xe2\\x82\\xac400m)./nIn the planning for years, they will whiz skiers up to the slopes in just a few minutes. But will they get any customers?/nBig neighbour Germany\\'s suggestion that Europe\\'s ski resorts should stay closed over Christmas and New Year has caused indignation. The Swiss sometimes see Germany as arrogant: Switzerland isn\\'t even in the European Union, and won\\'t, said health minister Alain Berset, \"react to pressure from other countries\". /nBut he knows he is treading a fine line. /nSwitzerland\\'s second wave has been tough, with some of the most intense transmission in Europe. Case numbers are falling now, but not as fast as the government would like. /nThe decision to manage the second wave with a \"slowdown\" rather than a full lockdown pleased business leaders, but many Swiss citizens, watching the rising death toll, are uneasy./nSo now the government is in a dilemma./nClose the ski resorts and face fury from some desperate, but also politically powerful, alpine cantons - home to Zermatt, St Moritz, or Wengen? Or keep them open and face fury from its neighbours?/nFrance has already said it will conduct border checks to stop its citizens skiing abroad, while Austria and Germany will impose quarantine on their citizens returning from Swiss slopes. These measures signal that if Switzerland decides to stay open, its neighbours will just seal it off anyway./nHoping to salvage the festive season, Canton Graub\\xc3\\xbcnden will close its restaurants for the next two weeks and Canton Berne has a 21:00 curfew. /nNightclubs have been closed for weeks - there may be skiing in Switzerland, but there is no apr\\xc3\\xa8s-ski. Masks are obligatory on lifts, even the open-air chairlifts. The resorts insist their safety concept is good, they have no intention of becoming a giant Ischgl - or Swisschgl, as one cynic here put it. /nAnd now the government has come up with some new rules too. Not, it insists, because of European pressure, but just to help the resorts stay safe. /nTo open, resorts must apply for a permit and will receive one:/nResorts can lose their permits if they do not comply. /nAs so often in Switzerland, it\\'s a compromise that hopes to please everyone and may end up pleasing no-one. /nAustria is reopening its ski slopes for Christmas, but not its hotels or its restaurants.

It should, he said, be \"evaluated differently\" to visiting restaurants or bars, where infections are more likely. /nMr Kurz, who doesn\\'t live near the mountains, said he wouldn\\'t personally profit from the open ski lifts himself, but he said it would be nice if people \"who have a ski resort near them have the chance to go skiing\"./nBut that doesn\\'t include people who live just across the border in countries such as Germany or Italy. In an apparent concession to Rome, Paris and Berlin, Austria is introducing a stricter quarantine regime over the holidays, from 19 December to 10 January. /nAnyone arriving from a country with more than 100 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people in the previous two weeks will have to quarantine for 10 days, although an early release is possible if they test negative after five days.  /nFranz H\\xc3\\xb6rl, spokesman for the association of cable-car operators in Tyrol, has criticised the Austrian government\\'s decision not to allow restaurants in the ski areas to open. He said it was irresponsible not to allow people up a mountain the chance to have a warm drink.  /nThere are hopes that winter tourism may be possible as of the second week of January, but everything depends on getting and keeping infection rates down.  /nSki resorts in neighbouring Switzerland, however, stand to make a tidy profit over Christmas and New Year./nWhether the Swiss approach will actually work will only be clear from the level of infections sometime in mid-January. /nCoronavirus: How Europeans are preparing for Christmas and New Year/nJohnson and EU chief seek to break Brexit deadlock/nEU and UK negotiators call in leaders in last ditch effort to secure a trade deal./nWill a vaccine give us our old lives back?/nRussia begins Covid vaccinations in Moscow/nThe neo-Nazi who became an anti-Nazi/n\\'I had surgery to be three inches taller\\'/nIt\\'s rare to find art that blows you away.

      "saving to /bbc/e707d6f9-0f94-2092-4bc3-b3173c24f7f1.txt: b'By Flora DruryBBC/nOn Monday, New Zealand\\'s Maori woke up to an apology from one of the country\\'s biggest media organisations, Stuff: \"No matou te he; We are sorry.\"/nIt came after a months-long deep dive into their own reporting which found their coverage of Maori issues had \"ranged from racist to blinkered\" over the company\\'s 160-year history./nThe investigation does not make for pretty reading. Scouring its papers, journalists found early, openly racist front pages and recent letters full of bile. It found a tendency to over-report on Maori child abuse cases, while playing down similar crimes in the European, or Pakeha, community. It found countless occasions where it simply hadn\\'t bothered to ask the Maori community for their side of the story, siding instinctively with the more powerful white population./nIt had, as Stuff\\'s editorial director Mark Stevens said in an editorial published the same day, divided the country into \"two separate groups, us and them\"./nFor Carmen Parahi, the apology was personal. She had seen up close the issues uncovered by the investigation during her 20-year career as a journalist in New Zealand, and she had dedicated months to leading the investigation for Stuff. But more importantly, it meant something to her as a Maori woman./n\"Until the day it dropped, I didn\\'t think it would happen,\" she told the BBC. \"As a Maori woman, I have seen the impacts of how the media has portrayed Maori over generations, and felt it - because we are a collective people. Mention Maori in a story and collectivise Maori in the stories as we have been, then you are telling me that I am a child abuser, or that I am part of this terror group./n\"It is all these things that the media keep saying, Maori you need to sort this out, Maori you need to do this, and that starts to play on your view of yourself.\"/nParahi hadn\\'t needed to look far to see how the media\\'s portrayal had affected the Maori people - she found it in the racist letters to the editor carefully pasted into a scrapbook belonging to her grandfather after he died./n\"I thought, why did my grandfather keep these letters to the editor? He must have kept them because [of] what they said in those letters - \\'We have got to stop them being savages\\'. He wants to prove them wrong. He wants to show them what it means to be Maori. That must have really hurt him. And I feel really hurt for him.\"/nStuff\\'s investigation found the company had, in some ways, made massive strides away from the coverage of its first newspapers. Set up by settlers for settlers, it had in 1870 described the Maori as \"a bloodthirsty and semi-barbarous race\"./nBut that did not mean it had done enough./nTake how New Zealand\\'s mainstream media covered a series of police raids on a suspected terrorist ring back in 2007, which saw hundreds of officers swoop on a remote, majority-Maori area. /n\"They actually shut down the whole community,\" Parahi explains. \"In that community, they were holding families in their homes. They stopped [school] buses, they frightened the whole community.\"/nThe raids would eventually result in no-one being tried for terrorism. Four people were found guilty of firearms-related offences and the police eventually apologised to the community for their actions./nBut the Stuff investigation found their reporting had also fallen short./n\"We were so busy worrying about the idea that all these people were creating terror plots we didn\\'t step back and we did not represent that community,\" Parahi says. \"If this was a community in Auckland or Wellington or Christchurch, there would have been an uproar from the public about how heavy handed the police [were]. But we did not stand up for Maori. We did not as journalists take all sides against the powers and authority of the state.\"/nA few months ago, Parahi reached a crossroads./n\"I love the high principles of journalism,\" she explains. \"What I do not like is when we use a monocultural lens to get some understanding. I\\'ve been doing stories for years about institutional racism against Maori. I thought this year, why am I continuing to do this if the journalism industry could also be accused of institutional racism./n\"The news media was set up in Britain. It was then imported as Britain colonised the globe. It has been very Western\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 it is a white perspective. It means anyone outside of that framework loses their voice./n\"And personally, I got fed up with the way we were reporting on Maori. So either I leave the industry, which I love, or do something about it.\"/nParahi decided on the latter, and from here it was a case of \"right place, right time\". Stuff is New Zealand-owned for the first time in its history, and she got support from colleagues across the spectrum before approaching the company\\'s chief executive, Sinead Boucher, with a simple message: we need to change, and we need to be more representative./nBoucher\\'s response? \"I\\'ve been thinking about this - how do we do it?\"/nSix months later, Stuff published its apology and admitted - loudly - it had been racist. /nImportantly, it has also pledged to do things differently going forward. Among other things, the group has established a \"Pou Tiaki\" section, which will showcase Maori stories, with Parahi as its editor./nBut Parahi is keen to stress: \"This is not about me or what I want.\"/n\"This is about the whole company,\" she says. A few days after the newspapers were published, it dedicated seven ad-free pages to the investigation - a sign it was putting its money where its mouth is. They all know we have to be more representative.\"/nIt seems the public also know this. Yes, there have been some subscription cancellations, and a few complaints but they were two-to-one in favour of the move. /nParahi admits that she was hoping it would be three-to-one, but was quietly reminded by a colleague that a few years ago \"it would have been 10-to-one the other way\". What\\'s more, the website - which is paid for by a combination of advertising and donations - had its most successful day ever for donations. /nBut it is the impact on the wider Maori community which really stands out./n\"I cried when the news broke on Monday. I absolutely bawled,\" Glenis Philip-Barbara, New Zealand\\'s first assistant Maori commissioner for children, told One News./nThe Stuff apology was an \"admission of something you and I have lived with all our lives\"./n\"Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think this day would come,\" she told Maori journalist Jenny May Clarkson. \"For us at the Children\\'s Commission, we see and we hear from children every single day to live in a nation which assumes that you are inherently criminal, that will follow you around in a shop, to live with a teacher that thinks that, as a brown kid, you will never amount to much.\"/nReactions like this just go to show Parahi and all the other Stuff journalists\\' hard work was needed./n\"We are always holding power to account - when will we hold ourselves to account? Journalism is part of our democracy,\" she points out./nAnd how does she think her grandfather would feel, reading the apology?/n\"He would have loved it.\"/nNew Zealand: Book pulled after author criticises Maori tattoo/nKia Ora: Air New Zealand faces boycott over trademark bid/nAir New Zealand drops ban on staff tattoos/nThe countries grappling with their European heritage/nplayNZ anniversary: Captain Cook \\'visited murder upon our people\\'/nJohnson and EU chief seek to break Brexit deadlock/nEU and UK negotiators call in leaders in last ditch effort to secure a trade deal./nWill a vaccine give us our old lives back?/nRussia begins Covid vaccinations in Moscow/nThe neo-Nazi who became an anti-Nazi/n\\'I had surgery to be three inches taller\\'/nIt\\'s rare to find art that blows you away.

      "saving to /bbc/928aafbe-194c-3208-5cb1-cf0e3664d36c.txt: b'By Deirdre FinnertyBBC News/nIn the middle of the last century, thousands of students from African countries were studying at Irish universities. Some had children outside marriage, who were then placed in one of Ireland\\'s notorious mother and baby homes. Today these children, now adults, are searching for their families./nAs a child, Conrad Bryan wondered if his father was a king. He was from Nigeria - or so he had been told - a place Conrad imagined was far more exciting than the orphanage outside Dublin where he lived. /n\"When you want something and you can\\'t have it, your imagination takes over,\" he says. /nDespite his persistent questions, the nuns couldn\\'t tell him anything about his father\\'s family - or about kings in Nigeria. In 1970s Ireland, the only things he learned about African countries were from the TV, or stories about the black children pictured on the charity boxes people would donate money to during Lent. /nWhen a missionary priest who had returned from Nigeria came to the orphanage, he spoke to Conrad, who was fascinated by his stories of Nigerian tribes. The priest told the boy his father might not have been a king exactly, but a doctor who studied in Ireland. /nConrad worked hard at school and as he grew older longed to find a job, so that one day he could afford to travel to Nigeria. The one detail he had been told about his father was his surname - Koza. /nConrad was born in Dublin in 1964 to an Irish unmarried mother. He spent his early life in one of Ireland\\'s infamous Church-run, state-funded mother and baby homes, St Patrick\\'s on the Navan Road. At that time, most unmarried women didn\\'t keep their children. The stigma made it impossible to get a job or rent a flat, and there was no state support available for women in this situation. /nConrad\\'s father was one of many African students who had come to study in Dublin. In the 1960s, the Irish government ran schemes supporting them in learning skills that would help them build up their own newly independent states. Most enrolled in Trinity College, University College Dublin, and the Royal College of Surgeons, studying subjects like medicine, law, and government administration. By 1962, at least 1,100 students - or one tenth of Ireland\\'s student population - were African, from countries like Nigeria, Ghana and South Africa, where there were strong links with Irish missionaries. /nBy 1967, an Irish military college had accepted a delegation of Zambian cadets. \"It\\'s natural\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 that Zambia\\'s young officials would be trained in a small independent country like Ireland, a country with no history of imperialism,\" a TV news report said at the time. /nBut the students weren\\'t always welcomed by the wider population. News articles reported attacks on African students and mentioned \"difficult landladies\" - a reference to housing discrimination, according to Dr Bryan Fanning, author of Migration and the Making of Ireland. Though some of the students had relationships with Irish women, it was rare that these led to marriage in the culture of the time. /nMany of the children from these relationships spent their early lives in mother-and-baby homes and were placed for adoption. Irish adoptions at the time were carried out under a closed system - where there is no contact or sharing of information between the adopted child and the natural parents.  To this day, adopted people do not have a statutory right to their early life files. Others, like Conrad, who were not adopted, were transferred to orphanages. For a child born outside marriage, their father\\'s name would not typically have appeared on their birth certificate. /nSome have spent years trying to discover their heritage. /nIn the late 1980s, Conrad had grown tired of being called names. There was an added stigma attached to the colour of his skin - people automatically assumed he had come from an orphanage. So he left Ireland for London, where he found work in an accountancy firm. /nBut he still had to deal with surprised looks when he said he was from Ireland.  /n\"Being constantly reminded that you\\'re not Irish is painful,\" he says. \"I really struggled with that. I didn\\'t know what my background was.\"/nWhen he was in his 20s, Conrad decided to look for his family. A nun at the orphanage contacted an Irish social worker and eventually, he got access to more of his personal records. His father\\'s name was not on his birth certificate, but on his records, it was listed as Joseph Conrad. There was no reference to the surname Koza. /nThe social worker contacted his mother, who shared what she knew.  For five years, it was a frustrating back and forth between the social worker, the religious orders, his mother and the Royal College of Surgeons (RCSI). Finally, he received a letter from the RCSI revealing his father\\'s full name - Dr Conrad Kanda Koza. /nBut there was more. The letter confirmed that Conrad\\'s father was South African, not Nigerian, as he had been told. /n\"That was a huge shock. I look back on it and think, \\'What a lie I had been living.\\'\" /nThe next steps of the search were down to him. He visited the British Library Newspaper Library in Colindale, north London, where he found South African newspapers and even a South African phone book. He then began cold-calling all the Kozas listed as living in Johannesburg. Eventually he got through to someone who could help him. Within a week, he received a telegram from a cousin, who put him in touch with his father\\'s sister. /nHis father had passed away in London many years previously, but the rest of the family welcomed Conrad warmly. /n\"They looked at a photograph and they claimed me straight away. It was a great affirmation of who I am, and who I should have known I was.\"/nHis aunt Thuli Koza visited him in London and gave him items that had once belonged to his father - his student card from the RCSI, and a letter he had written to the family in Zulu while living in Ireland. Over beers in the evenings, she told him about the family\\'s history. At one point, they were close to South African political exiles in London. /nHe kept up with the family in South Africa, honeymooning there with his new wife and visiting often after that./n\"I missed so much growing up,\" he says. \"It\\'s not just about your father, it\\'s about your roots - your cousins, your uncles./nMany other mixed-race Irish people, however, are still searching for information, decades after leaving homes and institutions. /nOutside a basement 20 yards from Dublin\\'s O\\'Connell Street - a busy thoroughfare lined with monuments to Irish independence - a handwritten sign points passers-by towards the Rapid Tailoring Alteration Service. The shop belongs to 79-year-old Jude Hughes, a tailor and long-standing anti-racism campaigner. For more than 30 years, Jude has sat in front of his machine altering garments, alongside photos of his children, and buttons stored in sweet containers. /nLike Conrad, Jude spent his early life in St Patrick\\'s mother and baby home. He was born on a spring day in 1941, to an unmarried machinist. His father, he would later be told, was from Trinidad. The rest of Jude\\'s childhood was spent in institutions - first in a convent, later in an industrial school. Growing up, he rarely saw another black person. /n\"You\\'d wonder why you weren\\'t like all the others. There would be no explanation, and I\\'d be embarrassed.\" /nAt 16, Jude trained as a tailor and went to work in Dublin. His ears pricked up every time he heard news on the radio about the civil rights movement in the US, or the achievements of black boxers like Joe Lewis. But the reality for him was being passed over for certain positions at work. In the early days, some customers in the tailoring shop avoided dealing with him. /n\"They\\'d see me and they would freeze. Some would say, \\'Ah I think I\\'m in the wrong place.\\'\" /nStill, Jude carried on, brushing off racist comments in the street. \"I got on with the business of getting on with my life,\" he says. He joined a band and played basketball. Later, as customers began to trust him, he set up his own business. At Christmas, he would visit one of the nuns from the institutions. They would joke that he would one day discover he was the son of an African chief. /nWhen his first son was born, Jude was desperate to share the good news, but he had no family members to ring, just the friends he had acquired over the years. As his son grew older, he started to ask questions. For a school project, he had to make a family tree, and Jude remembers the shame he felt at not being able to help him. /n\"There is nobody you can say is a relation of yours.\" /nOver the years, Jude watched from his shop as the city changed and faces like his own were more visible. In the 1980s, he became a founding member of one of the first anti-racism groups in Ireland. People of African descent greeted him on the street, claiming him as one of their own. But his own searches continued to yield little about his heritage. From his correspondence with the Irish authorities, he knew his mother\\'s name, her occupation, and the county she was from, but nothing  about his father - no evidence that he was from Trinidad.  /nIn 2015, the  homes Jude and Conrad spent their early lives in became the subject of a government inquiry, the Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation. The treatment of women and girls who gave birth there, high infant mortality rates, forced adoptions, and vaccine trials were all being investigated. /nBy then, Jude and Conrad were members of a group, the Association of Mixed-Race Irish (AMRI). The AMRI lobbied the government to examine the specific experiences of mixed-race people. Alongside their common experiences of racism and being cut off from their mixed-race identity, they asked for details about why it appears that mixed-race children were less likely to be adopted and more likely to be transferred to other institutions. /nThe government agreed to insert a clause requiring the commission to identify cases of racial discrimination in the homes./nConrad and Jude, along with many others, submitted evidence about their experiences, and the final report will be published soon. /nNow Conrad is helping Jude, and others looking for answers about their background.  /nAn accountant and auditor by trade, Conrad was a whizz at spreadsheets and charts, uncovering things that people preferred to keep hidden. He has, however, encouraged people to first engage with social workers for support. /n\"People are so lost. It\\'s part of the shocking story of lost identity and the shame of having a black father.\" /nMore from Deirdre Finnerty:/nBridget - like the other arrivals - was told not to speak about her life outside. /nAll of them were given a different name. None of the girls had committed any crime. But they had two things in common. /nThey were all unmarried and they were all pregnant./nRead: The girls of Bessborough/nConrad had also acquired a wealth of knowledge over the years. He discovered that there had been a great deal of media interest in the African students who studied in Ireland in the early decades of independence. He\\'d learned, too, about freedom of information requests, and how helpful the universities could be. /nAnother useful resource were ship passenger lists, and he had found out how African students had made the journey to Ireland. This is the sort of highly-specific information that Irish social workers would not be trained to find, and a combination of these sources had enabled him to successfully track down the Nigerian father of another member of the group. /nIn Jude\\'s case, he set up his family tree on Ancestry.com. By researching publicly available birth and marriage certificates, they found the town Jude\\'s mother was from, and some more information about her family. The charts revealed an unexpected biological relative for Jude - Conrad is a distant cousin on his mother\\'s side. /nOn his father\\'s side, they have worked with a genetic genealogist. DNA testing has revealed that Jude\\'s father is most likely Nigerian. Inputting this information into Jude\\'s Ancestry chart, Conrad started to search for DNA relatives. A distant cousin has been tracked down and has agreed to a DNA test to help narrow things down.  /nThrough their work with AMRI, Jude and Conrad continue to meet people much younger than them, who are only embarking on their search for their African heritage. /nMarguerite Penrose was born in 1974, spending three years of her early life in St Patrick\\'s mother and baby home. /nMarguerite\\'s experience, however, was different in some ways from that of Conrad and Jude. /nShe was fostered, and eventually adopted, by a family in Dublin, with whom she enjoyed a happy childhood in the north of the city. She was surrounded by supportive extended family and many friends. /nBut as she got older she became increasingly aware of how different she was to others in her neighbourhood. She also spent long periods in hospital receiving operations for congenital scoliosis, and was frustrated that she couldn\\'t answer any questions about her medical history./n\"It\\'s another complete part of your genetics that you know nothing about. As you get older, it\\'s very important to know if there\\'s heart disease, cancer in your family.\"/nWhen Marguerite\\'s adoptive family finalised her adoption in the early 90s, they received some background information - her natural mother\\'s surname, the area where she was from, and the fact that she has since remarried with other children. It confirmed what Marguerite had already been told about her natural father - that he was a cadet from Zambia, but his name or surname were not included./nFor years, Marguerite wondered whether to begin a formal search but she had heard stories about the mother and baby homes, and about incorrect information that those who had been born there had been given. /n\"I think of my birth mother, and I think, \\'God, what did she go through? Did she willingly give me up? I don\\'t know,\\'\" she says. Last year, after another spell in hospital, she started the process with social workers to trace both of her natural parents. /n\"To get the answers to the millions of questions that spill around your head, it would mean the world.\" /nThe final report into mother and baby homes will include survivor testimonies and a social history of the homes from 1922-1998. An apology to those affected is expected, and Conrad, Jude and Marguerite hope the government will acknowledge the specific experiences of mixed-race people. /n\"We\\'re telling our stories in the hope that the state will learn from this. In the hope of protecting the diverse minorities we have got now,\" Conrad says. /nJude wants the government to provide funding and training for researchers to help others like him find their African origins. /n\"Denial of our background left a big void in a lot of people\\'s lives. Some are terribly damaged by what they went through.\" /nThe Minister for Children, Roderic O\\'Gorman, has said he is \"determined\" to do right by survivors and adopted people, and is \"committed to introducing legislation to resolve the issues\". /nBut some remain sceptical things will change quickly. Most of the records collected as part of the commission will be sealed for 30 years, though a database that will assist with tracing and personal data requests will be transferred to the Irish authorities. /nIn the meantime, Jude is optimistic that with Conrad\\'s continued help he will get a result before his 80th birthday. And when his case is completed, Conrad will move on to the next one. /n\"It\\'s such a joy to help people,\" he says. \"It gives you back something that you\\'ve lost.\" /n\\xc2\\xa9 2020 BBC.

      "saving to /bbc/533ce307-b807-5ebb-0102-317829103833.txt: b'By Katy WatsonBBC News, Venezuela/n\"We\\'ve come here to show our faces, to tell the truth, to walk the streets with you so you can tell us your problems, and we can solve them,\" hollered candidate Nicol\\xc3\\xa1s Maduro Guerra, addressing a crowd of about 500 on the Caribbean coast of La Guaira. /n\"I\\'m not coming here to promise you castles and mansions, I can promise though that we will come through this.\"/nBut coming from \"Nicolasito\" as he\\'s known, might be hard for some to swallow. For Nicolasito is the president\\'s son and under Nicol\\xc3\\xa1s Maduro, Venezuela\\'s once oil-rich economy has crumbled. /nEvery day, millions of people in Venezuela struggle to access enough food, annual inflation is above 5,000% and about five million people have fled the country in search of jobs and more stability. The pandemic has just compounded the problems here./nDespite his family links, Nicolasito is pretty assured of victory. He\\'s set to gain one of 277 seats in the National Assembly on Sunday, made all the easier because the opposition is boycotting the vote. /n\"It\\'s the duty of all Venezuelans to exercise their vote,\" says supporter Darwin Quintero. \"We have to fix our problems and hope the people we vote in can solve them. That\\'s why we have elections.\" /nPlenty in the crowd, though, are taking part begrudgingly. /n\"I have to vote because I have a government job,\" one woman said. She didn\\'t want to be identified. /n\"I don\\'t want to vote because I\\'m not happy with what is happening - I have two jobs, four kids and I am practically dying of hunger - I work to eat.\"/nAnd what of the opposition?  /n\"There\\'s no opposition here, just God,\" she says./nRewind nearly two years, and Venezuelans were hopeful of change. /nIt was January 2019 when Juan Guaid\\xc3\\xb3, as speaker of the opposition-led National Assembly, said that he would be the man to end President Maduro\\'s reign and lead the country to free and fair elections. /nAs he was citing the constitution as allowing him to take over, many countries were quick to back him as Venezuela\\'s legitimate leader.   /nTens of thousands of people came out onto the streets to support him - he had approval ratings of more than 60%. But in the time since, Juan Guaid\\xc3\\xb3\\'s popularity has plummeted to around 25%. President Maduro is still in Miraflores Palace, and the country is going nowhere. It\\'s stalemate. /n\"We all wish the transition was quicker,\" says Mr Guaid\\xc3\\xb3, defending the criticism he\\'s failed to make things better. /n\"When you don\\'t have water, when you have to queue three days for petrol \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 when your family is far from you\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 evidently survival is a full-time job.\" /nBut he insists he\\'s doing what he can. Instead of participating in Sunday\\'s vote, the opposition has decided to hold its own \"consulta popular\" between 7 and 12 December./nIt\\'s effectively a referendum, asking people about the country\\'s political future. /nBut few seem enthusiastic - many don\\'t really know much about it. And experts question its legitimacy as much as they do the elections. /n\"This is probably the worst situation for leaders and political parties of the opposition since the times of Hugo Chavez,\" says historian Margarita L\\xc3\\xb3pez Maya, referring to Nicol\\xc3\\xa1s Maduro\\'s predecessor and man who began the leftist \\'Bolivarian revolution\\' in Venezuela. \"We are finishing the cycle of Guaid\\xc3\\xb3.\"/nSo what next? Come 5 January, when the new National Assembly is inaugurated, Juan Guaid\\xc3\\xb3 will no longer be an elected official. /nBut Mr Guaid\\xc3\\xb3 insists that the international community continues to support him.  It\\'s the importance of the international community, though, that troubles some analysts./n\"You don\\'t resolve an internal political problem with international politics unless you\\'re talking of an invasion,\" says Luis Vicente Leon, President of Caracas-based polling firm Datanalisis. /n\"The main issue is the internal fight and that was weakened to such a point that the opposition ended up being totally dependent on international politics.\" /nIn the new year, Mr Guaid\\xc3\\xb3 runs the risk of being jailed by the Maduro administration if he continues to lead a parallel government. But he says he\\'s not going anywhere.  /n\"I will stay in in Caracas to defy the regime,\" he says. \"We know the main objective of Maduro and the dictatorship is to annihilate the democratic alternative.\"/nAnd what of passing the baton?  /n\"I was chosen by the people, and then by parliament,\" he explains. \"The important thing is the objective, not who sits in the chair. It\\'s not just about one person, it\\'s a movement.\" /nL\\xc3\\xb3pez Maya is doubtful. She says the opposition and government are so far apart, most Venezuelans don\\'t want anything to do with either side now. /n\"They have to understand they need to leave the polarised discourse because it\\'s a zero-sum game in which they have lost all the time they\\'ve played.\"/nAdditional reporting by Vanessa Silva/nVenezuela crisis: How the political situation escalated/nplayLeopoldo L\\xc3\\xb3pez: \\'I never wanted to leave Venezuela\\'/nVenezuela crisis in 300 words/nJohnson and EU chief seek to break Brexit deadlock/nEU and UK negotiators call in leaders in last ditch effort to secure a trade deal./nWill a vaccine give us our old lives back?/nRussia begins Covid vaccinations in Moscow/nThe neo-Nazi who became an anti-Nazi/n\\'I had surgery to be three inches taller\\'/nIt\\'s rare to find art that blows you away.

      "saving to /bbc/964de6de-8bc1-e883-8e26-1d4e465c7bd3.txt: b'By Ashitha NageshBBC News/n One of President Donald Trump\\'s earliest and most controversial moves was a travel ban on people from certain nations he said were deemed a security threat to the US. Joe Biden has promised this will be one of the first policies he reverses. /nThe ban  - which now applies to 13 countries - has survived many legal challenges, but for some families it has meant years of separation.  /nAfkab Hussein is a Somalian lorry driver who has never lived with his sons./nWhen he first moved to Ohio in 2015, Afkab Hussein planned for his pregnant wife to join him the following year. /nBut while his wife and children now live in Kenya, they are Somali citizens - and Somalia was one of the countries on the first iteration of the travel ban./nSince he moved, he has only been able to pay a couple of very short visits to his family - and missed the births of his two young children. /n\"It\\'s been a really tough few years. It\\'s been really hard,\" he says. \"I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever forget the last four years.\"/nMr Hussein works long, lonely hours, driving lorries in 40 states across the country. He speaks to his wife on the phone, but an eight-hour time difference means that for large stretches of his day, his family is fast asleep./nHe has missed all of the major milestones in his sons\\' lives so far: \"Yesterday was my first son\\'s fifth birthday - and I wasn\\'t there.\"/nMr Hussein knew that during his campaign Mr Biden had promised to lift the ban in his first 100 days, and was hopeful./nAlly Bolour, a lawyer with American Visas in California, says he is optimistic these families will be able to meet again, but argues that even before the travel ban young Muslim men like Mr Hussein faced discrimination in the US visa system./n\"Before Trump, even during [the term of former president Barack] Obama,\" this was an issue, Mr Bolour says./n\"Even people who go for consular processing for \\xc3\\xa9migr\\xc3\\xa9 visas can be subjected to sometimes years-long background checks if they\\'re Muslim, if they\\'re male, between certain ages and from certain countries. /n\"What Donald Trump did was effectively... what the government was doing already, but in the form of a travel ban.\"/nSome argue that the ban is an effective counter-terrorism measure, but caught up in the visa refusals are also families who just want to be together. /nMina Mahdavi from Campbell, California, has a mother in Iran who has never been able to visit her grandson. /nPregnant with her first child in 2016, Mina Mahdavi applied for a tourist visa so her mother could visit from Iran. She really needed her mother\\'s support getting ready for the baby.  /nOne month later Donald Trump took office and in his first week, he signed an executive order imposing a travel ban on citizens of five Muslim-majority countries. One of those countries was Iran./n\"For the first couple of minutes [after hearing the news] we were all in denial. We thought: \\'This is not going to happen ... I\\'m legal here, she\\'s applying for a tourist visa.\\' But then the visa process went on and on and on, and my kid was born... it was rough,\" she says./nAlthough the visa application had been submitted just before the ban was announced, it took more than a year to be processed - before it was finally rejected. /nHer son is now three-and-a-half and her mother still hasn\\'t been able to visit./nRaising a new baby without the support of her mother left Ms Mahdavi - who had postpartum depression - feeling alone and desperate./n\"I\\'m happy I have him, my son,\" she adds. \"But to be honest, I would never have had a kid if I\\'d known that my mum wouldn\\'t be here.\" /nShe was able to make one short trip to Iran, but the journey from California was long and her infant spent most of the time crying from jet lag. She thought about the difference it would make for her mother to see him in his own home.  /nEventually, she just \"had to get used to not having that emotional support, not being able to have my parents come and go\"./nAlthough the ban applies to all citizens of countries named in the ban, some have been eligible to apply for a waiver. But Ms Mahdavi\\'s mother was rejected without waiver consideration. For her, the whole process was opaque.  /nBrittney Rezaei, an immigrants\\' rights attorney with the Council for American-Islamic Relations (Cair), says that applying for waivers for their clients has been really challenging./n\"The [government] never put out clear guidance about what would qualify for a waiver... so we were never able to provide guidance to our clients about what the process would be.\"/nHaving exhausted all avenues, including calling up the Supreme Court, Ms Mahdavi faced the possibility that the ban would be in place until at least 2025. /n\"I thought my kid would be eight years old before my mom would be able to come visit us,\" she says. Now, she is hopeful that her mother can finally hug her grandson./nGulnara Niaz, a Kyrgyz photographer in Boston, says she needs her parents to help her son understand his roots. /nThe central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan was added to the ban in January this year, a move  which left Ms Niaz perplexed but for her it meant that she would not be able to connect her son with her parents. /n\"He\\'s totally disconnected from our culture,\" she says. \"Even when he was younger, about 12 or 13, he said to me, \\'Mom, you don\\'t understand how hard it is to have a mother who had your upbringing. You\\'re not like every other mother.\\'\"/nMs Niaz grew up in a nomadic community in rural Kyrgyzstan, and tries to keep her traditions alive in Boston - particularly when it comes to food. Her son, she says, is perplexed when he sees her growing her own onions./n\"He could learn more about our traditions,\" she adds. \"Maybe he could learn Russian, or even our mother tongue, the Kyrgyz language.\"/nIf her parents were allowed to visit for a couple of months, it would help him connect with her identity - she says the travel ban made this a struggle in her life./nMore about Trump\\'s travel ban:/nWhat is the Trump travel ban?/nUS election 2020: Trump\\'s impact on immigration - in seven charts/nUS election 2020: The farmer helping Mexican immigrants/nUS election 2020: Why Trump gained support among minorities/nJohnson and EU chief seek to break Brexit deadlock/nEU and UK negotiators call in leaders in last ditch effort to secure a trade deal./nWill a vaccine give us our old lives back?/nRussia begins Covid vaccinations in Moscow/nThe neo-Nazi who became an anti-Nazi/n\\'I had surgery to be three inches taller\\'/nIt\\'s rare to find art that blows you away.

      "saving to /bbc/d081dc0e-be20-c492-7f2b-ce9b449781ad.txt: b'By Geeta PandeyBBC News, Delhi/nIndia\\'s first female comic superhero Priya, a gang-rape survivor who earlier campaigned against rape, acid attack and sex trafficking, is back to fight disinformation around the Covid-19 pandemic./nIn Priya\\'s Mask, due to be launched on 2 December, the comic crusader joins hands with Jiya, the \"Burka Avenger\", a popular character from a Pakistani cartoon show, as the two go about trying to tackle the pandemic - and also the \"infodemic\", a major proliferation in fake news surrounding the coronavirus./nWith more than 9.4 million infections and 137,000 deaths, India has the second highest caseload globally. A strict nationwide lockdown that was imposed on 21 March delayed the spread for a while, but infections grew rapidly - and continue to do so - since restrictions were relaxed./nA major challenge in India\\'s fight against Covid-19 has been the false and misleading information around the pandemic, which is often shared at lightning speed./nSince the first infections were reported earlier this year, millions of people with smartphones have received hundreds of messages each about supposed cures, lockdown rumours and conspiracy theories on Covid\\'s origins. Claims that frequently sipping warm water, shunning meat and poultry, or taking homoeopathic medicine could prevent infection have regularly landed in people\\'s inboxes./nFear and carelessness have seen people flouting orders to wear masks in public places or maintain social distancing. In some places, frontline workers, including doctors and nurses were attacked, even barred from their own homes by neighbours fearful of catching the virus./n\"Through this campaign, we wanted to challenge misinformation, dispel fear, and support the health workers and others at the forefront of the fight against the virus,\" Ram Devineni, the Indian-American creator of the Priya comic series, told the BBC./nHe launched the \"modern-day feminist superhero\" in December 2014, two years after the brutal gang rape of a young woman on a bus in Delhi, to focus attention on the problem of gender and sexual violence in India. The series has subsequently been named a \"gender equality champion\" by UN Women./nIn Priya\\'s Mask, she arrives riding the flying tigress Sahas (Hindi for courage), to battle \"an invisible monster - a deadly virus unlike any we\\'ve seen before\"./nAs she flies into the city, she sees masses fleeing on foot - a reminder of the early days of the lockdown in India when tens of thousands of poor migrant workers walked for days to return home while factories, offices and transport shut down./n\"There\\'s a quiet sense of fear. Everyone is hiding in their homes. It seems as though time has stopped,\" she observes./nDelhi-based writer and theatre actress Shubhra Prakash, who wrote the script of Priya\\'s Mask, says she incorporated her personal experiences into the story./n\"During the early weeks of the lockdown, we were not allowed to leave home at all. So I spent a lot of time in my balcony. My access to the world was quite restricted. We were all isolated and it was difficult for everyone. So when you see Meena, a little girl who\\'s one of the main characters in the story, standing alone in her balcony, daydreaming, that was also me./n\"And when the lockdown began to ease and we could step out, a \\'new normal\\' emerged. We had to wear masks and maintain social distancing,\" she says./nIn Priya\\'s mask, Meena is invited to hop on to Sahas\\' back for a tour of the becalmed city./nThey see deserted roads; Meena spots her favourite ice-cream parlour where no one is queuing up any more; she sees her friend who\\'s as isolated as she is; and hears voices - at times irrational and fearful. At the hospital, she watches her mother, a nurse, heroically tending to Covid-19 patients./n\"We wanted people to understand that these are extraordinary times. And we wanted to highlight the role of Covid heroes since we felt they were not being talked about much,\" Ms Prakash says. /n\"There was a lot of stigma surrounding the illness and we were trying to say that people need to be open-minded. What is keeping the world moving during the pandemic? The sacrifices made by the frontline workers, who go to work to keep us safe.\"/nIn the comic, Priya also partners with Jiya, the Burka Avenger, who\\'s fighting to protect her city Chutneyville against a villainous assault by Baba Kaboom, who plans to take it over by not wearing a mask and spreading the virus./nBut, in the process, he himself catches Covid and needs help from Priya and Jiya.  /n\"The most important message it conveys is we have to look at the world with compassion and not give up on humanity. We can only conquer the virus if we work together,\" Ms Prakash says./nIndrani Ray, co-producer of a two-minute animation film based on Priya\\'s Mask (seen at the top of this story), says the pandemic has impacted everyone\\'s life and although \"our lockdowns are different, our experiences are the same\"./nMs Ray, who lives in Mumbai, says her parents live in Kolkata and she has not been able to see them the entire year. \"I\\'m afraid to visit, just in case I carry the infection and pass it on to them.\"/nHer colleague Tanvi Gandhi says her involvement in the project was in part due to personal loss./n\"I lost someone in my family to the virus, and it all happened so quickly. In a matter of four weeks, it was all over./n\"That\\'s when you realise it\\'s not just a statistic, not a social media forward, it\\'s something very tangible that is impacting all of us. It is as real as it can get.\"/nThe animation is voiced by feminist icons in Bollywood and Hollywood, including Rosanna Arquette, Vidya Balan and Mrunal Thakur and 12-year-old Sairah Kabir. /nThe comic, which targets young people and has augmented reality features, can be downloaded for free anywhere in the world./nMr Devineni, who lives in the US, says Priya\\'s Mask would have relevance not just in India, but globally since the pandemic has impacted people across the world./n\"New York, where I live, looked post-apocalyptic. And if you see images from European cities, many of them did too. Every time I stepped out, I could only see homeless people, it was surreal, the eeriest site I\\'ve ever seen.\"/nHis father, a paediatrician who has practiced in South Jersey since 1975, had to stop working for the first time since he was in the vulnerable group for Covid-19./n\"He\\'s 80 and has health complications and we knew if he got it, he would have just died. In fact, two of his very close doctor friends - I had grown up calling them uncles - died from Covid. We watched their funerals on Zoom.\"/nMr Devineni says when the US embassy in Delhi got in touch with him in April, asking if he\\'d be interested in creating a new Priya comic to launch in December for the United Nation\\'s 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-based Violence, \"I wondered if we would be outdated by then\"./n\"I knew the virus would still be there and the campaign would have some resonance. Also, 10 years from now, this artwork, created during the pandemic would be a historical document, a documentation of how people dealt with it at the emotional and visceral level,\" he says, adding, \"but I think it\\'s going to be much more than that.\"/nFor, almost a year since the pandemic began spreading, large parts of the world are still in the grip of the virus. In Delhi, and the US, numbers continue to explode as the global infections cross 62 million, with 1.5 million dead. /nAnd the World Health Organisation and governments in many parts of the words are still finding it a challenge to get people to wear masks or maintain social distancing. Last month, Delhi government raised the fine for not wearing masks in public from 500 rupees ($7.50; \\xc2\\xa35.00) to 2,000 rupees after repeated warnings fell on deaf ears./nAnd that, Mr Devineni says, means that Priya\\'s Mask has more relevance than ever./nArtwork by Syd Fini and Neda Kazemifar/nIndia\\'s new comic \\'super hero\\': Priya, the rape survivor/nIndia\\'s raped comic \\'super hero\\' returns to fight acid attacks/nPriya: India\\'s female comic superhero returns to rescue \\'stolen girls\\'/n\\xc2\\xa9 2020 BBC.

From Morocco, the journey takes five days, but from countries further down the coastline it can take twice as long./nThe number of arrivals in 2020 is more than 10 times the total number for 2019. \"I wouldn\\'t want this for anyone because it\\'s not good, but if it\\'s the only way to make a proper living, what can we do?\"/nMohamed Zitouni had gone to find his brother at a wharf on the southern tip of the island of Gran Canaria where at one point some 2,600 migrants had been staying in tents or sleeping rough./nArguinegu\\xc3\\xadn wharf had been used as a makeshift migrant camp ever since the surge in numbers of people arriving or being picked up at sea by rescue services./nThey had spoken by phone the previous day, before Rahali\\'s battery ran out. Days after they were reunited, the camp was dismantled. /nThe emergency caused by undocumented arrivals to the archipelago shows little sign of easing./nIn November alone, about 7,000 migrants reached the archipelago, which has seen the highest number of migrant arrivals since 2006. /nConditions on the quayside were cramped and lacked many basic services. In theory, the authorities are allowed to keep them there for 72 hours in order to carry out coronavirus PCR tests and legal procedures, although many migrants reportedly stayed much longer./nAn increase in controls on other routes from Africa to Europe - across the Mediterranean to Greece, Italy and mainland Spain - has helped make this more perilous journey across the Atlantic more popular. /nRelatively good weather conditions have also been a factor. /nHowever, more than 600 migrants have drowned making the crossing this year, according to UN figures./nSah\\xc3\\xa9 Sephore was 13 months old when she and her mother fell in the water as the boat carrying them and some 30 other people hit rocks near the coast of Gran Canaria in May 2019. /nShe was the first undocumented migrant to be buried formally with their name and surname on a tombstone in the Canaries, reports say./nSea arrivals in Spain in 2020: 35,862/nArrivals in Canary Islands: 19,493/nDeaths on Canary Islands route: 650/nSource: UNHCR/nThe Spanish government has been paying for around 6,000 migrants to stay in 17 hotels which had been empty or closed because of the impact of Covid-19 on the local tourism industry. Others are staying in makeshift camps./nA Senegalese man, also called Mohamed, is staying in the Vista Oasis hotel. He made the crossing in September but says he found out that his two younger brothers both drowned while making the same journey since then. /n\"We have sacrificed a lot to come here, to work, to get a better life,\" Mohamed told the BBC. \"Because in Africa, if you\\'re not from a family linked to the state, or from a rich family, you\\'re not going to live well. That\\'s what Africa is like.\" /nHaving arrived on the islands, Mohamed is now confused about his legal status and whether he will be able to travel on to mainland Spain or another European country, as he would like./n\"We\\'ve already heard certain rumours, that the Senegalese will have to return home but I don\\'t know if it\\'s true or false,\" he said. \"Right now, many Senegalese are very frightened, because if we return to Senegal, we don\\'t get anything, no work or anything.\"/nInterior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska has said that the Socialist-led Spanish government prefers not to transfer migrants to the mainland, in order to \"prevent irregular entry routes into Europe\"./nThe administration has started engaging with some African countries, including Senegal, in order to ease the repatriation of migrants, a process that can be legally complex. /nCritics have accused the Spanish government of failing to prepare for this crisis, which they say led to chaos on Arguinegu\\xc3\\xadn wharf and has put local services under pressure. Ana Oramas, a congresswoman from the Canary Coalition (CC) party, described the situation on the archipelago as \"a powder keg\". /nIn recent weeks there have been demonstrations both in favour of and against the immigrants, reflecting the varying reactions of locals to their arrival./n\"This is an invasion,\" said Antonio Santana Hidalgo, who works in the tourism industry. \"I respect that everyone has to make a living and survive, but they have to understand you can\\'t just put them up in a hotel with everything included and have them lazing about.\"/nAiledis Unsu\\xc3\\xa9, who works in a bar, has a different perspective. /nHairdresser Jos\\xc3\\xa9 Mar\\xc3\\xada Rodr\\xc3\\xadguez pointed out that Spaniards also had a history of emigration. \"People from the Canaries, Galicians and Basques, we all emigrated,\" he said. \"The difference with this type of migration is that they are coming from countries that are at war, where there\\'s no work and things are really bad.\"/nThe Spanish government says new facilities currently being prepared will house 7,000 migrants, meaning the hotels will be able to be evacuated. /n\"I think that, despite the difficulties, we have handled this in an agile way,\" said Hana Jalloul, Spain\\'s secretary of state for migration./n\"We\\'re not going to make a Moria out of the Canaries,\" she added, referring to the Greek island of Lesbos where fires destroyed an overcrowded migrant camp in September./n\"It\\'s not our style of migration policy.\"/nCanary Islands sees 1,600 migrants arrive over weekend/nJohnson and EU chief seek to break Brexit deadlock/nEU and UK negotiators call in leaders in last ditch effort to secure a trade deal./nWill a vaccine give us our old lives back?/nRussia begins Covid vaccinations in Moscow/nThe neo-Nazi who became an anti-Nazi/n\\'I had surgery to be three inches taller\\'/nIt\\'s rare to find art that blows you away.

      "saving to /bbc/d823a027-5a07-fef7-f9fd-c682e8f21e54.txt: b'Today, the idea of taking a photograph and never seeing the result is hard to comprehend, as we shoot away with our digital cameras or smartphones, instantly sharing photos we take. But wind the clock back to the time when photography was an analogue process, and the delay between taking the picture and seeing the prints could be many months, even years - long enough to forget. And for one roll of film, at least, the wait has been about 70 years./nCamera collector William Fagan obtained a number of film cassettes some years ago, when he bought a Leica IIIa./nAnd though he knew one contained film, he only recently set out to develop it./nThey were made, by the Leica Camera company, at a time when film was sold in bulk reels and keen photographers would load their own reusable 35mm cassette. /nAs it was bulk film, there was no way to identify its speed. /nSo Mr Fagan had to calculate the development time using best guesses./nBut after consulting with experts, he was ready to go ahead./nHis plan worked./nAnd he now has 20 printable negatives. /n\"Normally when I develop a roll of film, I have some idea of what it contains,\" he says. /n\"In the darkroom, I could see old cars./n\"But it was not until I scanned the images that I had a clear idea about the contents. /n\"I was not sure which of my old Leica cameras the film cassette had come with./n\"But I believed it was from a camera from the mid-1930s. /n\"The first negative which I scanned was the one showing a mid-1930s BMW convertible with what appear to be Bavarian plates (AB 52 3287), on a snowy mountain pass.\"/nAnother frame showed La Veduta hotel, on the Julier Pass, in Switzerland./nAnd research revealed the car is a BMW 315.   /nOther locations included a High Street in Bellagio, on the shores of Lake Como, in northern Italy (above), and Zurich\\'s Bahnhofstrasse (below), which led Mr Fagan to revise his guess as to the date of the pictures, to the early 1950s./nBut it is the people that really interest him./n\"The real shock came when I saw the personal photos of the people, a woman and a man with a family pet on a trip around Switzerland and northern Italy,\" he says./nAnd he is keen to identify those people so he can pass on the prints./n\"Such photographs are usually regarded as very personal mementos of happy times,\" he says./n\"And I really felt that I, as a stranger, should not be looking at them./n\"Then I thought again about the fact that no-one would ever have seen these photos if I had just thrown away the roll and had not developed it./n\"I thought about the ages of the people in the photos and the possibility that neither of them might still be alive. /n\"I felt that, even if they were no longer with us, their families might wish to see the photos. /n\"Then there were further thoughts about why the roll of film, which contained some lovely pictures, was never finished or developed./n\"As a keen photographer I have always felt that people take photographs for a reason and that photographs record moments in time which can never be recorded again, as such moments do not repeat themselves.\"/nSo if anyone out there recognises the people in the picture, Mr Fagan would love to hear from them./nYou can contact him via Mike Evans\\'s website, using the address: info@macfilos.com  /nHere are a few more shots from the roll of film./n\\xc2\\xa9 2020 BBC.
